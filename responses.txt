Map Analysis:\n\n- **Initial Position:** The bottom left corner of the map.\n- **Path Identification:** Use the cost map to find the lightest path from the initial position to each room in the sequence: Hall, Bedroom, Kitchen, Dining Room.\n\n### 2. Waypoint Generation:\n\nWeâ€™ll identify clear paths visible on the cost map from one room to the next. Here's a rough outline of the path based on analysis:\n\n1. **Path to Hall:**\n   - Move to (10, 180) \n   - Navigate right to (30, 180)\n   - Move up to (30, 160)\n   \n2. **Path to Bedroom:**\n   - Navigate right to (60, 160)\n   - Move up to (60, 140)\n   \n3. **Path to Kitchen:**\n   - Move right to (100, 140)\n   - Navigate down to (100, 100)\n   \n4. **Path to Dining Room:**\n   - Move right to (140, 100)\n   - Navigate down to (140, 60)\n\n### 3. Path Optimization:\n\n- Ensure waypoints adhere strictly to accessible, light regions on the cost map.\n- Avoid paths closing in dark areas to maintain low-cost traversal.\n- Use primarily horizontal and vertical movements to simplify navigation.\n\n### Output Waypoints:\n\nHere are the sequence of waypoints for the path:\n\n- [(10, 180), (30, 180), (30, 160), (60, 160), (60, 140), (100, 140), (100, 100), (140, 100), (140, 60)]\n\n**Path Adjustments:**\n\nThis path has been optimized to ensure transitions between rooms avoid high-cost areas as indicated by darker regions. By prioritizing lighter areas, the robot can ensure a smooth journey through the Hall to the Dining Room.

Darker regions suggest obstacles or high traffic areas, whereas lighter regions highlight easily navigable paths.\n\n### Path Calculation:\n- The Dining Room is typically a larger, open area often located in residential or office floor plans.\n- By analyzing the maps, let's assume the Dining Room is identified in a particular open space. Here are estimated coordinates for the goal within a large open space.\n\n### Goal Coordinates:\nBased on typical spatial arrangements and assuming the bottom left represents a starting position:\n\n- **Dining Room Location:**\n  - **Primary Goal:** Assuming the Dining Room is in the bottom-right quadrant, a possible target coordinate could be approximately \\((150, 150)\\).\n\n- **Waypoints:** If a non-direct path is needed (e.g., maneuvering through open doors or avoiding high-cost areas), break into waypoints:\n  - \\[(80, 180), (150, 150)\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nSelect the path/unveil waypoints that best follow open spaces while avoiding obstacles and high-cost areas in the cost map.
